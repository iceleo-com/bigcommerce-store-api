     * Update an Order
     *
     * Updates an *Order*. 

     To add a product to an existing order, don't include `id` in the body. Include `product_options` if adding a product with variants.

     To update a product in an order, include `id` in the body. The body should only contain the fields that need to be updated. Those fields that are omitted will not be changed.

     To remove a product from an order, set that productâ€™s `quantity` to `0`.

     After the update, the PUT request clears all discounts and promotions applied to the changed order line items. Since the order data syncs with other ERP systems, like Amazon or eBay, the updated order returns to the default setting, removing any applied discounts.

     To update order fees, include the fee id in the request body along with all relevant fee fields. Fees not included will be deleted. Fees with an id will be updated, and fees without an id will be created as new.

     **Notes**

     * Sub-resources like products in the /v2/orders PUT request behave like PATCH, updating only the provided fields. Fees, however, follow standard PUT semantics and fees in the request body will fully replace existing ones. 
     To retain an existing fee, include it in the body with its associated id. 
     * The values for cost_ex_tax, cost_inc_tax and cost_tax in the fees payload should reflect the tax rate associated with the tax_class_id. For a 10% tax rate, the difference between cost_inc_tax and cost_ex_tax should be 10%. If no tax_class_id is provided, the store's default "tax class for fee" will apply. Incorrect data may lead to issues in downstream operations like refunds.

     *

     Create an order with an existing catalog product or a custom product.

     **Required Fields**

     * `products` or `consignments`
     * `billing_address`

     When you create an order, the `consignment(s)` array allows you to create pickup consignments.
     - An order can have either a pickup or a shipping fulfillment method, but not both.
     - An order can have only one pickup consignment.

     Choose from one of the following:
     1. Create order with a shipping fulfillment method using `shipping_addresses` and `products`, i.e. legacy mode
     2. Create order with a pickup fulfillment method using `consignments`, i.e. Consignment mode

     You can fulfill an order with shipping or pickup, but not both.

     This means that if the `consignments` array is present in the request, then _none_ of the following may be present and vice-versa:
     - `shipping_addresses`
     - `products`

     Include the `fees` object along with all its attributes in the request to create order-level fees for the newly created order.

     **Notes**

     * The values for cost_ex_tax, cost_inc_tax and cost_tax in the fees payload should reflect the tax rate associated with the tax_class_id. For a 10% tax rate, the difference between cost_inc_tax and cost_ex_tax should be 10%. If no tax_class_id is provided, the store's default "tax class for fee" will apply. Incorrect data may lead to issues in downstream operations like refunds.

     **Required Fields**
     *   order_address_id
     *   items

     **Usage notes**

     There are three methods for generating a tracking link for a shipment:

     1. Use `shipping_provider` and `tracking_number`: This generates a link to one of our integrated providers that you can click from the BigCommerce control panel and customer-facing emails. If a merchant still needs to set up a shipping provider or if the provider is not one of our natively integrated providers, you will click on an Aftership tracking link instead. The `generated_tracking_link` property in the API response represents one of these tracking links. The `tracking_link` property in the API response will remain empty.

     2. Use `tracking_carrier` and `tracking_number`: This also creates a link to one of our integrated providers or an Aftership tracking link that you can click in both the BigCommerce control panel and customer-facing emails. Like the previous method, the `generated_tracking_link` property in the API response represents this tracking link. The `tracking_link` property in the API response will remain empty.

     3. Supply a custom `tracking_link`: By providing a value for the `tracking_link` property, you can use your own tracking link within the BigCommerce control panel and in customer-facing emails. The API response will return your supplied tracking link as part of the `tracking_link` property in the response. In situations when there isn't a `generated_tracking_link`, the property in the API response will remain empty. 

     Acceptable values for `shipping_provider` include the following, and this list may be updated at any time: 
      - `""`, an empty string
      - `auspost`
      - `canadapost`
      - `endicia`
      - `usps`
      - `fedex`
      - `royalmail`
      - `ups`
      - `upsready`
      - `shipperhq`
      - `carrier_{your_carrier_id}`, when the carrier is a [third-party Shipping Provider](/docs/integrations/shipping) 

     Acceptable values for `tracking_carrier` include an empty string (`""`) or one of the valid [tracking-carrier values](https://www.aftership.com/docs/tracking/others/supported-couriers).
